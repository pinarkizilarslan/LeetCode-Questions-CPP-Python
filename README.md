## Question 224: Basic Calculator
Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
**Note:** You are ***not*** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

Examples:
- `
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
`<br>
- `
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
`<br>
- `
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
`

## Question 432: All O'one Data Structure
Design a data structure to store the strings' count with the ability to return the strings with minimum and maximum counts.

Implement the AllOne class:
* `AllOne()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
* `inc(String key)` Increments the count of the string `key` by `1`. If `key` does not exist in the data structure, insert it with count `1`.
* `dec(String key)` Decrements the count of the string `key` by `1`. If the count of `key` is `0` after the decrement, remove it from the data structure. It is guaranteed that `key` exists in the data structure before the decrement.
* `getMaxKey()` Returns one of the keys with the maximal count. If no element exists, return an empty string `""`.
* `getMinKey()` Returns one of the keys with the minimum count. If no element exists, return an empty string `""`.

## Question 1046: Last Stone Weight
You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the i<sup>th</sup> stone. <br>
We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the ***heaviest two stones*** and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:
* If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
* If `x != y`, the stone of weight ***x*** is destroyed, and the stone of weight ***y*** has new weight `y - x`.<br>

At the end of the game, there is ***at most one*** stone left.<br>
Return the smallest ***possible weight of the left stone***. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

## Question 1496: Path Crossing
Given a string path, where `path[i] =` `N`, `S`, `E` or `W`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.
<br>
Return ***true*** if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return ***false*** otherwise.
