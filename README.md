### Question 224: Basic Calculator
Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

Examples:
- `
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
`<br>
- `
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
`<br>
- `
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
`
